# resosuma-data

This repository holds data on activity in the research software sustainability
space ("the space"). *resosuma* is short for *re*search *so*ftware
*su*stainability *ma*p.

Activities in the space are recorded as a relation (*action*) between *actors*
and *actees*.

The data file `resosuma-{semver}.csv` holds the data in the CSV format.
The three columns correspond to the *actor* (col 1), *action* (col 2), and
*actee* (col 3) respectively.

## Version history

- `resosuma-0.4.1.csv` fixes issues #3 and #4.

- `resosuma-0.4.0.csv` is the version that is part of the final submission to
[WSSSPE6.1](http://wssspe.researchcomputing.org.uk/wssspe6-1/).

- `resosuma-0.3.0.csv` renames the "Code repositories" node to "Code platforms".
This is the version that is part of the submission to
[WSSSPE6.1](http://wssspe.researchcomputing.org.uk/wssspe6-1/).

- `resosuma-0.2.0-draft.csv` is a refined mapping of the research software 
sustainability space.

- `resosuma-0.1.0.csv` is a mapping of Daniel S. Katz' original visualization of
the research software sustainability space, as presented in a talk [1].

## Contributions

Contributions to the data is strongly encouraged.

Please create an issue to request being made a team member.

If you find an activity that is missing from the data, please fork the 
repository, add the new activity to the CSV file, rename the file with a new 
version number (these additions would be a new feature, so increment the second 
integer in the version number by one), and submit a pull request.

If you think that the model can be improved more fundamentally, please open an
issue to discuss your ideas.

# Processing

The CSV data can be processed with the 
[*resosuma* package for Python](https://github.com/research-software/resosuma).
